**Sprint 4 Recap**

What are we going to do:

- Robot needs to dynamically learn its environment through a recogniztion phase of the place.
    - To do that we need that the robot has to:
        - explore the perimeter of the room and sends a message to the KB whenever it finds something;
        - find the table in the room and send its position to the KB and add it as an obstacle.

This ends Sprint4.
