# Sprint #1

In this sprint we achieved a few important things.

First thing we were able to do was to be able to let the robot walk the whole perimeter and then come back in the RH position (as defined in requirements).

To do this:
RUN MainCtxRobotMind.kt
RUN MainCtxMindButler.kt

Second thing we did was to use the planner to achieve what we called TEST PLAN #1. With the planner we are able to set a goal (the fridge, for now); the planner calculate the moves
and walk the robot through them. Once goal is reach, it comes back to position RH.

To do this:
RUN MainCtxRobotMind.kt
RUN MainCtxMindExplore.kt
