# Sprint 2

In this sprint we attach a planner so that our robot can start to understand how to plan moves for doing actions.
The goal is also to set and write a testgoal (using JUnit) which is the following:

*Robot needs to move to the Fridge position*

## About Fridge Position

Fridge position is given *a priori*. We might set it in a file, containing the positions of the room. The best would be setting it in the knowledge base (in Prolog) and get it from there.
